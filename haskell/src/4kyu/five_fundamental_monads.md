# Description:

In this kata we will implement five of the most fundamental monads.

Newcomers to Haskell find monads to be one of the most intimidating concepts but on a basic level - they are not too difficult to understand.

A datatype forms a monad if it is possible to complete the following definitions such that the monad laws (described below) hold. There's nothing more to it! For a more intuitive understanding then there are a plethora of tutorials which use (sometimes wild) analogies to explain this concept.
```
class Monad m where
    return :: a -> m a
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```
Monad laws
```
return x >>= f = f x
m >>= return = m
(m >>= f) >>= g = m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)
```
It turns out that many different types of computation can be encapsulated by monads. For example the `Maybe` monad encapsulates a computation which can fail and `State` a computation with mutable state.

The five we will implement here are `Identity`, `Maybe`, `State`, `Writer` and `Reader`.
