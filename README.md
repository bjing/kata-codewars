# Codewars Kata
I keep track of all my solutions to Codewars Kata here. I know Codewars keeps track of the Kata I've done as well as the solutions, having them here gives me the feeling that they are mine.

Currently I mainly focus on Haskell Kata. My solutions may be ugly, but one day when I look back upon the struggles, I want to have a smile on my face and realise how far I've come.

## Install Haskell
You need a Haskell environment to run the Haskell programs.

On OSX, you can do:
```
brew install ghc cabal-install
cabal update
```

On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install ghc
```

## Feedback
Any critiques welcome.
